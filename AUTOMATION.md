# Automation & Architecture

How PortfolioRank stays current with **no manual work**. This is the source of
truth for the data flow and the GitHub Actions.

## Data flow

```
emmabostian/developer-portfolios (upstream, community-curated)
        │  (only MERGED entries — upstream review is the trust gate)
        ▼
  sync-upstream Action  ──rebuild──►  data/feed.json
        │                               = upstream − excluded.json + additions.json
        ▼
  roster sync  ──►  rows not in feed.json marked delisted (Turso portfolios.delisted_at)

```

## The list (two intake doors + a takedown)

`data/feed.json` is rebuilt daily as **`upstream − excluded.json + additions.json`**
(deduped by normalized URL; original URL strings preserved so DB keys never break).

| Source | Trust | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Upstream merge** | High (Emma reviewed it) | Auto-pulled by `sync-upstream` |
| **Direct submission** | Unvetted | Issue form → `data/additions.json` |
| **Takedown / opt-out** | — | "Remove my portfolio" issue → `data/excluded.json` (dropped forever) |
| **Our own cleanup** | Health check, confirmed over 2+ weeks | `health.yml` → `data/excluded.json` (reason, dates, evidence) |

### Our list wins (owner decision 2026-11-10)

PortfolioRank runs its own cleanup instead of relying on the community list being right, and background jobs only work on sites on the current list.

- **Roster sync** (`pipeline/roster.mjs`, run by capture, judge, prewarm and the health check): database rows whose URL is no longer in `feed.json` get `delisted_at`; a URL that comes back is restored.
  Grading, the AI voting pool, prewarm and the site only use listed rows that are not confirmed down.
  After 30 days delisted, `purge-delisted.mjs` deletes the row's R2 screenshots and the row (and its `psi:`/`inspect:` cache entries).
  Votes and ratings stay: the vote log is the source of truth for ELO, and the leaderboard only shows roster URLs, so rankings stay consistent.
- **Health check** (`pipeline/health.mjs`, weekly): every listed site is checked for loading, parking, blank pages, duplicates and a stored `is_portfolio=false`.
  States: `live` → `suspect` (any failure) → `down` (3 failed checks in a row spanning at least 13 days); a pass resets to `live`.
  Bot walls (403/429 challenges) are inconclusive and leave the state alone; free-tier apps answering 502/503/504 get a second look after 30 seconds.
  A redirect to another domain is a move, not a failure: the run summary lists moves (and flags targets that don't carry the person's name) so the stored URL can be updated.
  When more than 30% of sites fail in one run the runner is the likelier culprit, so nothing is recorded and the job fails.
- **Portfolio-likeness** (`pipeline/signals.mjs`, part of the health check): from each loaded page's HTML (the rendered DOM for single-page apps) it records six yes/no signals in `portfolios.signals`: projects/work section, about, contact (mailto, form or social links), resume/CV, a GitHub profile link, and the person's name in the title or h1.
  A page with at most one is flagged `needs_review`: never removed or hidden for it, listed in the run summary, and graded first by the rubric so Gemini's `is_portfolio` confirms or clears it.
- **Exclusions**: newly confirmed-down sites are appended to `data/excluded.json` as `{url, name, reason, kind, removed, first_failed, last_checked, checks}` and dropped from `feed.json` in one bot pull request (branch `data/health-exclusions`, auto-merge), at most 10% of the list at once.
  `generate_feed.py` reads both these objects and the older plain URL strings.
  `/removed` lists them with the reason and date; takedown requests are counted there but never named.
- **Site visibility** (`lib/roster.ts hiddenUrls`): a roster site is hidden when it is confirmed down, or when its capture failed and the health check hasn't passed it since.
  Captures that fail are retried with backoff (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, then 30 days), and a passing health check schedules a recapture at once, so one transient error never hides a site for good.
- **Feed shrink guard**: `generate_feed.py --max-shrink 0.05` refuses to write a feed more than 5% smaller than the current one, which fails the sync run instead of wiping the list.
- **Upstream** (`upstream-removals.yml`, monthly, opt-in): one pull request to emmabostian/developer-portfolios removing entries confirmed down (never `suspect` ones), each re-checked right before, at most 25, in the list's own removal format.
  It is a dry run (report only) unless started by hand with `dry_run` off or the repository variable `UPSTREAM_PR_ENABLED` is `true`, and it needs the `UPSTREAM_PR_TOKEN` secret.

## GitHub Actions (7 scheduled)

All run on GitHub-hosted runners. The repo is **public → unlimited free Actions
minutes**; the only real budget is the Gemini free tier. Every scheduled job
files (and de-dupes) a GitHub **issue on failure**, so nothing fails silently.

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does | Secrets |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`ci.yml`** | PR → main | `tsc --noEmit` and the Worker build; gates what the next deploy ships | none |
| **`sync-upstream.yml`** | daily 06:00 UTC + manual | Rebuild `feed.json` from upstream's merged README, commit if changed, then **capture + AI-grade** new sites (serve-frames → R2) | TURSO, GEMINI, R2 |
| **`judge-vote.yml`** | daily 13:00 UTC + manual | Gemini **pairwise-metrics voting**: compare S/A/B pairs by hero (from R2) + cached Lighthouse/polish signals, cast ELO votes (≤30/day, flash-lite chain only) | TURSO, GEMINI, SHOTS_BASE_URL |
| **`backup.yml`** | daily 05:00 UTC + manual | Gzip snapshot of `votes`/`ratings`/`ai_rubric` → private R2 bucket `portfolio-rank-backups` (~0.3 MB/run) | TURSO, R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_BACKUP_* |
| **`prewarm.yml`** | daily 09:00 UTC + manual | Warm the PSI (Lighthouse) + inspect (polish) caches for listed S/A/B sites without a fresh PSI result (never measured first, then oldest), by hitting the prod API, so the voting robot's comparisons have real metrics | TURSO |
| **`health.yml`** | Sundays 16:00 UTC + manual | Roster sync, health check of every listed site, exclusions bot PR, purge of rows delisted 30+ days. No Gemini | TURSO, R2, SYNC_BOT |
| **`upstream-removals.yml`** | 2nd of the month 17:00 UTC + manual | Dry-run report, or (opt-in) one PR to the community list removing confirmed-down entries | UPSTREAM_PR_TOKEN (optional) |

Schedules are staggered: backup (05:00) → sync+grade (06:00) → vote (13:00, clear
of the sync window). `sync-upstream` holds the `ingest` concurrency lock for DB
writes; `judge-vote` uses its own `ai-vote` group (write-light) so it never
queues behind a long sync.

## Budget model

- **Gemini (free tier, shared):** grading self-limits to *new* sites/day; voting
  capped at 30/day. Both abort cleanly on sustained 429s. See the AI judge
  section below for the models.
- **R2 (10 GB free):** ~570 MB of serve-frames (hero/mobile/full; motion strips
  stay local) + ~0.2 MB/day backups → far under the cap, $0.
- **GitHub Actions:** unlimited (public repo).
- **PSI/Lighthouse:** 25k runs/day — ample.

## AI judge (Gemini)

`pipeline/judge.mjs` calls Gemini through `pipeline/gemini.mjs`.

- **Key:** sent in the `x-goog-api-key` header, never as `?key=` in the URL.
  Newer AI Studio keys ("AQ." style) are rejected in the URL, and a URL key leaks into logs.
- **Models:** `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` first, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` as the backup (owner's choice, 2026-11-10).
  A call moves to the backup only when 3.5 is rate limited (429), overloaded (5xx) or unreachable.
  A rejected key (401, 403, 400 `API_KEY_INVALID`) or a bad request never falls back.
  When both models are unavailable, the chain is retried after 15, 30 and 45 seconds.
  `--model M` uses only `M`, with no fallback.
- **Failing loudly:** `judge.mjs` exits 1 when the key is rejected, when there was work and nothing was judged, or when most rows (or pairs) were skipped because their screenshots were unavailable, so the "Notify on failure" step files an issue.
  Skipped rows are counted on their own, never as attempted.
  The counts (queued, judged, abstained, errors, skipped) go to the run's job summary.
  Running out of daily quota after some successes still exits 0.
- **Which model judged:** each rubric stores the model that actually answered in `ai_rubric.model`, and each AI vote stores it in `votes.model`.
- **One AI voter:** every vote the flash-lite chain casts uses one logical rater id, `ai:flash-lite`, whichever model answered.
  `rater_id` is a voter's identity: the unique `(rater_id, pair_key)` index allows one vote per voter per matchup, and the judge skips pairs its rater id already voted on.
  Per-model rater ids would let the backup vote a second time on a pair the primary already judged, giving the AI two votes on that matchup and skewing ELO toward the AI.
  With one logical id, the database guarantees one AI vote per matchup, and the leaderboard (`ratings`, which never looks at `rater_id`) stays consistent.
  The first pairwise run moves the earlier `ai:gemini-3.1-flash-lite` votes to `ai:flash-lite` with `model = 'gemini-3.1-flash-lite'`, so the new judge does not re-vote those pairs.
  A model outside the chain (`--model M --allow-model`) is a different judge and votes as `ai:M`.

## Required repo secrets

`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
`R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`,
`R2_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (an R2 token with Object Read & Write on `portfolio-rank-backups` only),
`SHOTS_BASE_URL` (public R2 base). Optional: `GH_SYNC_TOKEN` (keep the upstream
fork mirror synced too). The app reads `SHOTS_BASE_URL` from `wrangler.jsonc` vars to
serve images.
